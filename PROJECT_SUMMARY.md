# Card Dispute - Project Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive chargeback management webapp called "Card Dispute" with full-stack architecture including frontend, backend, database, and hosting layers.

## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Technology**: React.js with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) with responsive design
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building

**Key Components**:
- LoginPage: Secure authentication interface
- Dashboard: Real-time dispute overview with statistics
- Layout: Navigation and app structure
- DisputeStatusChip: Status visualization component

### 2. Backend Layer
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security with bcrypt password hashing
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input validation
- **Middleware**: Custom authentication and role-based access control

**Key Features**:
- User authentication and authorization
- Dispute management endpoints
- Stripe and PayPal API integration
- Rebuttal system for dispute responses

### 3. Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Schema Design**: Normalized structure for users, disputes, and rebuttals
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- **Migrations**: Prisma migration system for schema evolution

**Data Models**:
- User: Authentication and role management
- Dispute: Chargeback case information
- Rebuttal: Response documentation and evidence

### 4. Hosting Layer
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local and production
- **Web Server**: Nginx for frontend serving and API proxying
- **Database**: PostgreSQL container with persistent storage
- **Networking**: Isolated network with proper service communication

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
- **Stripe**: Full dispute retrieval and evidence submission
- **PayPal**: Framework for dispute management (extensible)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse

### Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Agent)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection and security headers

### Development Experience
- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- TypeScript for type safety and better development
- Concurrent development servers
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
